# QUIZ

Hello, This web project is built on the React class of components. I think it comes with simple code and great functionality. There are 2 local identifiers, these are the ones that check whether the user is logged in and the second is if the user agrees to the rules of use of the website (Cookie) If you want to download a project it is simple you just need a Github Desktop or terminal. In the worst case, download the project and throw it in the file. Be sure to note the `npm install` while in the project file
